## Python Full Stack Playing Around
### Goals
- not to hose up the system i'm on
- **do it live d\*mn it, i'll do it live** (that ref makes me laugh every time)
- but really, I want to test out these API's on a domain/subdomain, not just on localhost
- i get no enjoyment doing things on localhost
- take the time to use virtualenv so I don't have to use **$ terraform taint** again
- Note: Currently on VERSION="18.04.1 LTS (Bionic Beaver)"

### Setup
- Using a page from [FullStackPython blog](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/python-3-flask-gunicorn-ubuntu-1804-bionic-beaver.html)

```bash
$ python3 --version
$ which python3
$ sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-pip python3-virtualenv
# Note for some reason we have to separately install python3-venv
$ sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```
The following NEW packages will be installed:
- binutils binutils-common binutils-x86-64-linux-gnu build-essential cpp cpp-7 dh-python dpkg-dev fakeroot g++ g++-7
  gcc gcc-7 gcc-7-base libalgorithm-diff-perl libalgorithm-diff-xs-perl libalgorithm-merge-perl libasan4 libatomic1
  libbinutils libc-dev-bin libc6-dev libcc1-0 libcilkrts5 libdpkg-perl libexpat1-dev libfakeroot
  libfile-fcntllock-perl libgcc-7-dev libgomp1 libisl19 libitm1 liblsan0 libmpc3 libmpx2 libpython3-dev
  libpython3.6-dev libquadmath0 libstdc++-7-dev libtsan0 libubsan0 linux-libc-dev make manpages-dev python-pip-whl
  python3-crypto python3-dev python3-distutils python3-keyring python3-keyrings.alt python3-lib2to3 python3-pip
  python3-secretstorage python3-setuptools python3-virtualenv python3-wheel python3-xdg python3.6-dev
The following NEW packages will be installed:
- python3-venv python3.6-venv
We installed virtualenv and pip to handle our application dependencies. 
```bash
$ pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools
$ mkdir venvs Projects 
$ python3 -m venv venvs/flask1804
$ source ~/venvs/flask1804/bin/activate
```
We are now safe to install within the virtual environments /bin and /lib w/out hosing up PROD

### TOOLS in Virtual Env Project
- So from now on, our primary package manager will be PIP and wheel?! Keep that in mind...
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/) = Python micro framework for building web applications.
- [Gunnison](https://gunicorn.org/) -  'Green Unicorn' is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX
```bash
$ pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install wheel
$ pip install flask gunicorn
```
- Now lets test out the env. We are going to create a file from the command line using the tee command...
```bash
$ cd ~/Projects
$ mkdir flask1804
$ cd flask1804
$ tee __init__.py << END
> from flask import Flask, Response
>
>
> app = Flask(__name__)
>
> @app.route("/")
> def index():
>     return Response("It works!"), 200
>
> if __name__ == "__main__":
>     app.run(debug=True)
> END
$ cat __init__.py
```
A sloppy but effective way to create our script. But it will work with python flask:
```bash
# Note: you're in your virtual env right?
$ python __init__.py
```
And it worked... but not so lucky with gunicorn. :( I keep getting a wierd error.

### Now, on to [gunicorn.org](https://gunicorn.org/)
Apparently it is this simple. I tried it. Same error. I went into the code and thought, what did I do? 
![](https://github.com/nealalan/api-stuff-201812/blob/master/images/Screen%20Shot%202018-12-12%20at%2012.06.32%20AM.jpg?raw=true)
SPACING. I fixed the spacing and wham! Apparently gunicorn is really picky about code indenting! 
![](https://github.com/nealalan/api-stuff-201812/blob/master/images/Screen%20Shot%202018-12-12%20at%2012.20.59%20AM.jpg?raw=true)
When I $ cat the file, it's a bit less indented. Maybe this is the reason, maybe not. But it.... worked.

### What is this gunicorn?
- Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) - a simple calling convention for web servers to forward requests to web applications or frameworks written in the Python 
- The more I looked into Gunicorn, it seems it's pretty meatless. Not a lot to it and it has to be used with other tool such as Django.
- Setting up gunicorn to work from the internet appears to be a challenge. I haven't found any comprenensive labs, but found [a doc on it](https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/gunicorn-docs/latest/gunicorn-docs.pdf).
- But after a few hours of reading, it really doesn't tell you squat about how it's working and gives an nginx.conf that has inadequate documentation/comments. 

## [Deploying A Flask RESTPlus API to AWS EC2](https://medium.com/@isaacndungu/deploying-a-flask-restplus-api-to-aws-ec2-5061450fdc56)
- Phase 1: setup your AWS Ubuntu Instance. (Warning sign 1 - Ubuntu 16 vs 18. We will see.)
- Phase 2: automatic deployment?

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the automation scripts
$ git clone -b deploy-automation https://github.com/indungu/devops-08.git setup/
# Step 2: Run the deployment script
# on second thought lets look at it first
```

So this script would have hosed my webserver. I'll scrape the deploy-backend.sh and pull what I need from it.

```bash
# new venv
$ python3 -m venv venvs/api
$ source ~/venvs/api/bin/activate
#
# Installing App dependencies and Env Variables
$ git clone -b develop https://github.com/indungu/yummy-rest.git ~/Projectrs/yummy-rest
$ pip install -r ~/Projects/yummy-rest/requirements.txt
```

Naturally, a bunch of the installs failed. Damnit. Every. Lab. Ever! Welcome to IT, right? It appears the install just failed to build wheels for everything using.

```bash
$ pip check
# everything appears to be okay... but just to be sure:
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade
```

Now we need to create an environmental variables file. I think this is where everything here might fall apart.

```bash
$ sudo cat > ~/Projects/.env << EOF
    export DATABASE_URL="postgres://budufkitteymek:095f0029056c313190744c68ca69d19a2e315483bc41e059b40d6d9fdccf2599@ec2-107-22-229-213.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/d2r8p5ai580nqq"
    export APP_CONFIG="production"
    export SECRET_KEY="mYd3rTyL!tTl#sEcR3t"
    export FLASK_APP=run.py
EOF
$ source ~/Projects/.env
```

### Configure NGINX
Create a new nginx.conf for this project... not clobering what I already have installed.

```bash
$ sudo bash -c 'cat <<EOF > /etc/nginx/sites-available/fire.neonaluminum.com
server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;
        server_name fire.neonaluminum.com;
        location / {
                # reverse proxy and serve the app
                # running on the localhost:8000
                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000/;
                proxy_set_header HOST \$host;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto \$scheme;
                proxy_set_header X-Real-IP \$remote_addr;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For \$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        }
}
EOF'
$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/fire.neonaluminum.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

Now we have NGINX all configured, we can go ahead and restart and verify it.

```bash
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
$ sudo nginx -t
```

Sometimes I have a hell of a time getting this to work. NGINX won't die. So I have to

```bash
$ ps aux | grep 'nginx'
# find the PID for nginx
$ sudo kill <pid>
```

Run certbot to reginster the domain name you're using if you're using one. I needed to expand my certs for my server. I was using https://fire.neonaluminum.com 

```bash
$ sudo certbot --authenticator standalone --installer nginx -d nealalan.com -d www.nealalan.com -d neonaluminum.com -d www.neonaluminum.com -d fire.neonaluminum.com --post-hook 'sudo service nginx start' -m neal@nealalan.com --agree-tos --eff-email --redirect -q --expand
```

### Launch the yummy-rest service
Add a launch script...

```bash
$ sudo cat > /home/ubuntu/Projects/launch.sh <<EOF
#!/bin/bash
cd ~/Projects/yummy-rest
source ~/Projects/.env
source ~/venvs/api/bin/activate
gunicorn app:APP -D
$ sudo chmod 744 /home/ubuntu/Projects/launch.sh
```

Configuration startup service...
```bash
$ sudo bash -c 'cat > /etc/systemd/system/yummy-rest.service <<EOF
[Unit]
Description=yummy-rest startup service
After=network.target
[Service]
User=ubuntu
ExecStart=/bin/bash /home/ubuntu/Projects/launch.sh
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF'
$ sudo chmod 664 /etc/systemd/system/yummy-rest.service
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl enable yummy-rest.service
$ sudo systemctl start yummy-rest.service
$ sudo service yummy-rest status
$ sudo ~/Projects/launch.sh
```
Somehow I got it to work...
- One issue I ran into was Chrome would not load the page because of cross-site scripting errors.
- Clear the cookies!

### I need a DB to use the API...

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt -y upgrade
$ cd ~/Projects
$ source ~/venvs/api/bin/activate
$ sudo apt install postgresql-client-common
$ sudo apt install postgresql
```

Output from the install was...

```bash
$ /usr/lib/postgresql/10/bin/pg_ctl -D /var/lib/postgresql/10/main -l logfile start
```
Now, using postgres...
```bash
$ sudo -u postgres psql
```
![](https://github.com/nealalan/api-stuff-201812/blob/master/images/Screen%20Shot%202018-12-15%20at%208.38.06%20PM.jpg?raw=true)

That let me in but I don't know where the SQL database is. So I did a locate:

```bash
$ locate yummy_rest_db
```

![](https://github.com/nealalan/api-stuff-201812/blob/master/images/Screen%20Shot%202018-12-15%20at%208.43.42%20PM.jpg?raw=true)

### [Database setup](https://github.com/indungu/yummy-rest#database-setup)
Coming back to it the next day with fresh eyes, I checked to see if postgres was running. It is. 

![](https://github.com/nealalan/api-stuff-201812/blob/master/images/Screen%20Shot%202018-12-16%20at%2013.41.02.jpg?raw=true)

```bash
# can't see to get user to work...

```


## sometime...
```bash
echo "# api-stuff-201812" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:nealalan/api-stuff-201812.git
git push -u origin master
```
